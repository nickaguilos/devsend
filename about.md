		<p><em>Send (v.)</em>: To finish a route from the ground all the way to the anchors without falling or resting on gear.</p>

		<p>Send defines our commitment to bring the latest Philippine climbing news to the forefront of our digitally-focused lifestyles. The magazine started as an idea: to have, in the midst of all the outdoor, mountaineering, and sports magazines, one that would fully cater to Filipino climbers and that would focus solely on rock climbing. </p>

		<p>Ultimately, Send aims for more people to learn more about the sport, to reach and inspire more Filipinos to start climbing, and to push the boundaries of Philippine climbing.</p>
