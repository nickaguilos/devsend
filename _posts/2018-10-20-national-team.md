### Gerald Verosil

*Full name: Gerald Verosil  
Age: 17 years old  
Hometown: Manila, Philippines (now based in Singapore)
Current residence  
Gym you started climbing: Onsight Climbing Gym, Singapore*

***

**Send**: When did you start climbing?  
**Gerald**: I started climbing 4-and-a-half years ago (13 years old)  

**Send**: What got you into climbing?  
**Gerald**: Started climbing because of my two older siblings who climb as well. I also wanted to try something new apart from the typical ball games and challenge myself.  

**Send**: What's your favorite part about climbing?  
**Gerald**: My favourite part of climbing is the physical and mental challenge it gives me every time I’m on the wall, and also getting to meet new friends from around the world!

**Send**: What keeps you going?  
**Gerald**: I continue climbing because I have dreams of becoming a World Champion in the future. But ultimately, it's my passion and desire to get better which drives me day in, day out. Also it's family! Everyone is a climber so I have to keep up with my equally-passionate siblings! 

**Send**: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this?  
**Gerald**: The biggest challenge I've faced in climbing so far and am still facing, is probably my own self-expectations. Climbing is a lot on mental strength as much as it is on physical. Until today, I often get lost in my own hunger for progress and it sets me back- all the more when I don't exactly have a coach to guide me. Climbing is always fun, but when things start to get serious (e.g. pursuing a career in climbing), it can really be stressful. I cope by surrounding myself with people who constantly push me and remind me to have fun.

**Send**: What's your favorite kind of hold and why?  
**Gerald**: I love slopers! Among the other hold types, I must say I feel strongest on slopers! Plus, it doesn't hurt my fingers!

**Send**: What is your favorite type of climbing?  
**Gerald**: My favourite type of climbing is Bouldering. Bouldering teaches me a lot about my body and movement, but above all, it helps me feel free and liberated! 

**Send**: What are your current goals now?  
**Gerald**: My current goal is to consistently produce results for Team Philippines in all competitions next year. Long term goal will be qualifying for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo! It is my dream.

**Send**: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?  
**Gerald**: Being part of an ever-evolving, ever-improving team with lots of potential is definitely a huge honour. As one of the youngest athletes, I am proud to represent the Philippines Climbing Team and be part of this project. Everyone in the team knows we're underdogs in the international competition scene, but that makes us all the more motivated to achieve great things in this sport for the Philippines.

### Iman Mora

*Name: Iman lorenzo G. Mora  
Hometown: Cagayan de Oro City  
Age: 29  
Occupation: Athlete  
Home gym: Viajero Climbing gym*

***

**Send**: When did you start climbing?  
**Iman**: I was first introduced to climbing when I was 11 but only got into it in 2010 

**Send**: What got you into climbing?   
**Iman**: My parents at first. Eventually I just fell in love with it on my own.

**Send**: What's your favorite part about climbing?  
**Iman**: The escape it gives and the unexplainable happiness i get from doing it.

**Send**: Why do you keep climbing?  
**Iman**: I keep climbing because I constantly learn new things and always have the urge to keep improving my movement, strength and skill. But mostly because I just love doing it and enjoy every moment I am on an artificial wall or outdoors on real rocks climbing.

**Send**: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this?  
**Iman**: The biggest would be climbing/training without injury, especially because it’s very demanding on the body. I have incorporated warm ups before climbing and stretching after as a must do.

**Send**: What's your favorite kind of hold and why?  
**Iman**: I love pinches. It used to be one of my weaknesses so I’m really happy to be able to hold on to different kind of pinches now. Fruit of labor thing.

**Send**: What is your favorite type of climbing?  
**Iman**: My favorite type is bouldering. I find it the most fun of all disciplines and can keep doing it all day if I could.

**Send**: What are your current goals now?  
**Iman**: My current goal is to stay healthy physically and mentally. It’s hard on us athletes to keep training our bodies and push limits so it’s very important for me to stay healthy and be ready to represent the country at anytime we have an upcoming competition. Also, to finish some projects I have outdoors.

Send: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?
Iman: I feel honored and at the same time excited to always have a reason to train harder as being part of the team.

### Washington Jusay

*Name: Washington Jusay  
Hometown: Cavite City  
Age: 33  
Occupation: Rope Access Technician/Climbing Coach  
Home gym:  Power Up Alabang*

***

**Send**:When did you start climbing?  
**Washington**: I started climbing when I was 22.

**Send**: Why did you start climbing?  
**Washington**: I’ve always been athletic, and I’ve tried all kinds of sports. I remember that I was looking for a new sport during that time, this was around 2007. My friends and I were walking inside the mall and we saw a small climbing gym inside this sports shop. We thought it would be interesting to try it out, and as an athlete I’m always up for a challenge. That’s how it all began.

**Send**: What's your favorite part about climbing?  
**Washington**: The best part about climbing is that no matter how strong you get, there will always be a problem or route that will give you a greater challenge. There is always a channel for growth and improvement.

**Send**: What keeps you going?  
**Washington**: For me, climbing is not just a hobby, it’s already a part of me. I can’t separate myself from it. If I don’t get to climb, I feel like a part of me is missing. When I climb, my problems and stress go away.

**Send**: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this?  
**Washington**: The biggest challenge I’ve ever had is when I got an injury that prevented me from climbing. Whenever I get injuries, I feel like all my efforts go to waste and I have to start from zero again. Because of this, I learned how to be more efficient and careful when training to prevent injuries.

Recovering from an injury affects me mentally as well. I need to keep myself motivated to train and not let the injury affect my training habits. If an injury prevents me from climbing, I just do cross training or other sports to keep myself fit until I can go back to climbing again.

**Send**: What's your favorite kind of hold and why?  
**Washington**: I'd say pinches as they require precision and concentrated power. Slopers, on the other hand, are my eternal downfall. But whether I love or hate them, different holds require different strength and skill. As I've said, I like challenging myself.

**Send**: What is your favorite type of climbing?  
**Washington**: I think I'm biased towards bouldering. I love big moves on boulder problems that makes you yell and scream. I like to climb hard on a short route. I like the complicated moves on good holds, weird body positioning, flagging hard, laying back, and big dynos.
 
**Send**: What are your current goals now?  
**Washington**: At the moment my goal is to get stronger without getting injured. I also want to pass on my knowledge to my students and to share all the experiences that I have gained through competitions and failures and hopefully, they learn from those too.

**Send**: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?  
**Washington**: It feels great as it has always been my dream to be part of the Philippine team. And now that I made it into the team, I’m going to keep training hard and do my best to represent my country well.
