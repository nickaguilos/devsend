<h2>Gerald Verosil</h2>

<em>
	Full name: Gerald Verosil <br> 
	Age: 17 years old <br>
	Hometown: Manila, Philippines (now based in Singapore)
	Current residence <br>

</em>

<strong>Send:</strong> When did you start climbing? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong> I started climbing 4-and-a-half years ago (13 years old)

<strong>Send:</strong> What got you into climbing? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong>Started climbing because of my two older siblings who climb as well. I also wanted to try something new apart from the typical ball games and challenge myself.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite part about climbing? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong>My favourite part of climbing is the physical and mental challenge it gives me every time I’m on the wall, and also getting to meet new friends from around the world!

<strong>Send:</strong> What keeps you going/why do you keep climbing? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong>I continue climbing because I have dreams of becoming a World Champion in future. But ultimately, it's my passion and desire to get better which drives me day in, day out. Also it's family! Everyone is a climber so I have to keep up with my equally-passionate siblings! 

<strong>Send:</strong> What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong> The biggest challenge I've faced in climbing so far and am still facing, is probably my own self-expectations. Climbing is a lot on mental strength as much as it is on physical. Until today, I often get lost in my own hunger for progress and it sets me back- all the more when I don't exactly have a coach to guide me. Climbing is always fun, but when things start to get serious (e.g. pursuing a career in climbing), it can really be stressful. I cope by surrounding myself with people who constantly push me and remind me to have fun.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite kind of hold and why? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong> I love slopers! Among the other hold types, I must say I feel strongest on slopers! Plus, it doesn't hurt my fingers!

<strong>Send:</strong> What is your favorite type of climbing? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong> My favourite type of climbing is Bouldering. Bouldering teaches me a lot about my body and movement, but above all, it helps me feel free and liberated! 

<strong>Send:</strong> What are your current goals now?  <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong>My current goal is to consistently produce results for Team Philippines in all competitions next year, including the SEA Games in the Philippines where climbing might be included. I am eyeing a podium finish there and I hope it comes true. Long term goal will be qualifying for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo! It is my dream.

<strong>Send:</strong> How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team? <br>
<strong>Gerald:</strong> Being part of an ever-evolving, ever-improving team with lots of potential is definitely a huge honour. As one of the youngest athletes, I am proud to represent the Philippines Climbing Team and be part of this project. Everyone in the team knows we're underdogs in the international competition scene, but that makes us all the more motivated to achieve great things in this sport for the Philippines.

<strong>Send:</strong> When did you start climbing? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> I was first introduced to climbing when I was 11 but only got into it in 2010 

<strong>Send:</strong> What got you into climbing? <br> 
<strong>Iman:</strong> My parents at first. Eventually I just fell in love with it on my own.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite part about climbing?
<strong>Iman:</strong> The escape it gives and the unexplainable happiness i get from doing it.

<strong>Send:</strong> Why do you keep climbing? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> I keep climbing because I constantly learn new things and always have the urge to keep improving my movement, strength and skill. But mostly because I just love doing it and enjoy every moment I am on an artificial wall or outdoors on real rocks climbing.


<strong>Send:</strong> What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> The biggest would be climbing/training without injury, especially because it’s very demanding on the body. I have incorporated warm ups before climbing and stretching after as a must do.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite kind of hold and why? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> I love pinches. It used to be one of my weaknesses so I’m really happy to be able to hold on to different kind of pinches now. Fruit of labor thing.

<strong>Send:</strong> What is your favorite type of climbing? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> My favorite type is bouldering. I find it the most fun of all disciplines and can keep doing it all day if I could.

<strong>Send:</strong> What are your current goals now? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> My current goal is to stay healthy physically and mentally. It’s hard on us athletes to keep training our bodies and push limits so it’s very important for me to stay healthy and be ready to represent the country at anytime we have an upcoming competition. Also to finish some projects I have outdoors.

<strong>Send:</strong> How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team? <br>
<strong>Iman:</strong> I feel honored and at the same time excited to always have a reason to train harder as being part of the team.

	Occupation: Senior Wall Climbing Instructor at Urban Peak Rock Climbing Gym <br>
	Home gym: Urban Peak Rock Climbing Gym
</em>

<strong>Send:</strong> When did you start climbing? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Nagsimula ako mag climb noong 2014.

<strong>Send:</strong> What got you into climbing? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Sa totoo lang, noon wala talaga akong idea kung ano ang wall climbing. Nadiscover ko lang iyon dahil kay Kuya Washington. 

Noong makilala ko si Kuya Washington, sinasama niya ako lagi sa mga pinupuntahan nya. At minsan, isinama niya ako sa gym, Urban Peak Rock Climbing Gym. Pinasubukan niya sa akin ang pag climb. Bouldering pa nga ang unang una nya pinagawa. Noon panahon na iyon, hindi ko alam kung paano ang magclimb, kung paano hawakan un mga holds - climb lang ako ng climb, sinusubukan matapos ang mga route na binibigay nila, habang gina-guide nila ako.

Masaya at nag-enjoy ako sa first experience ko sa climbing. At nakakatuwa sa pakiramdam na marinig kay Kuya Washington na mayroon ako potential maging climber.


<strong>Send:</strong> What’s your favorite part about climbing? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Favorite part sa climbing....un pag climb mismo at syempre, maflash ang mga route. Pero, climbing bilang isang sport - gusto ko dito ay ang unti unti kong natututunan magkaroon ng disiplina at focus sa buhay, at madami kang nakikilalang mga tao. 

<strong>Send:</strong> Why do you keep climbing? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Sa ilang taon ko sa pagclimb, unti unti na nitong hinubog ang pagkatao ko. Natulungan ako ng climbing na makilala ko sarili ko, madiscover ko un mga kahinaan ko at kalakasan ko. <br>

Sa maikling salita, nabago nito ang buhay ko - nagkaroon ng sense, ng kulay at direksyon. <br>

Kaya patuloy ako magka-climb dahil sa climbing na umiikot ang buhay ko. Naniniwala ako na may mararating ako sa climbing. Ang mga goals ko, ang mga pangarap ko, matutupad at mararating ko, dahil masaya akong naging climber ako.

<strong>Send:</strong> What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Training. Ang biggest challenge para sa akin ay ang pag train. Bilang isang climbing instructor sa gym, hindi ko maiwasan na tamarin mag-train kung saan ako nagttrabaho.
Madalas pa, wala na akong nakakasabay mag train mula nang magtrabaho sa ibang bansa si Kuya. <br>

Paano ko na-overcome....
Sinubukan ko ng maige baguhin un mindset ko. Pinipilit ko at pinu-push ko araw-araw ang sarili ko na magtrain dahil para sa akin din naman un - para sa paglakas ko, at para mas maging handa sa mga competitions.
Sinusubukan ko na pumasok ng mas maaga sa work para habang walang client - makakapag-training ako, makakapag focus ako.


<strong>Send:</strong> What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?  <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Slopers. Sobrang nakaka challenge ang mga slopers. Bawat sloper, may kanya kanya itong paraan para mahawakan. Di pwede na basta basta lang ito hahawakan.  Para makahawak ka sa sloper kailangan ng matinding body tension and patience.


<strong>Send:</strong> What is your favorite type of climbing? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Bouldering. Madalas mag isa lang ako nagka-climb. Madalas mag isa lang ako mag train.Kaya mas naappreciate ko ang bouldering. Pwedeng pwede ako mag climb kahit wala ako kasama. Unlike sa lead climbing kailangan ng belayer.

<strong>Send:</strong> What are your current goals now? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Una, ang mas makapag focus pa lalo sa training para mas maging handa pa sa mga darating na mga competitions. Pangalawa, ang mas mapakilala sa mga tao, sa Pilipinas lalo na dito sa Cavite ang climbing - bilang isang sport, bilang isang hobby, at bilang isang klase ng workout. Mapromote na Climbing is fun! Pangatlo, maintroduce ang Urban Peak Rock Climbing Gym sa mga aspiring climbers - taga Cavite man o hindi, para mashare ko rin un mga alam ko about climbing, hopefully makapag inspire, dumami makasabay ko mag climb, at mag train eventually.

<strong>Send:</strong> How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team? <br>
<strong>Zoren:</strong> Masaya ako nang naging part ako ng Philippine National Climbing Team.Noong nag uumpisa pa lang ako mag climb pinangarap ko na maging part ng isang team. Pinangarap ko na marepresent ang bansa natin sa mga competitions. Kaya ang maging part ng Philippine National Climbing Team its a dream come true!

<strong>Send:</strong>When did you start climbing? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> I started climbing when I was 22.

<strong>Send:</strong> Why did you start climbing/what got you into climbing?  <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> I’ve always been athletic, and I’ve tried all kinds of sports. I remember that I was looking for a new sport during that time, this was around 2007. My friends and I were walking inside the mall and we saw a small climbing gym inside this sports shop. We thought it would be interesting to try it out, and as an athlete I’m always up for a challenge. That’s how it all began.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite part about climbing? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> The best part about climbing is that no matter how strong you get, there will always be a problem or route that will give you a greater challenge. There is always a channel for growth and improvement.

<strong>Send:</strong> What keeps you going/why do you keep climbing? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong>For me, climbing is not just a hobby, it’s already a part of me. I can’t separate myself from it. If I don’t get to climb, I feel like a part of me is missing. When I climb, my problems and stress go away.

<strong>Send:</strong> What is the biggest climbing related challenge you've faced and how did you overcome this? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> The biggest challenge I’ve ever had is when I got an injury that prevented me from climbing. Whenever I get injuries, I feel like all my efforts go to waste and I have to start from zero again. Because of this, I learned how to be more efficient and careful when training to prevent injuries. <br>

Recovering from an injury affects me mentally as well. I need to keep myself motivated to train and not let the injury affect my training habits. If an injury prevents me from climbing, I just do cross training or other sports to keep myself fit until I can go back to climbing again.

<strong>Send:</strong> What's your favorite kind of hold and why? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> I'd say pinches as they require precision and concentrated power. Slopers, on the other hand, are my eternal downfall. But whether I love or hate them, different holds require different strength and skill. As I've said, I like challenging myself.

<strong>Send:</strong> What is your favorite type of climbing? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> I think I'm biased towards bouldering. I love big moves on boulder problems that makes you yell and scream. I like to climb hard on a short route. I like the complicated moves on good holds, weird body positioning, flagging hard, laying back, and big dynos.
 
<strong>Send:</strong> What are your current goals now?  <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> At the moment my goal is to get stronger without getting injured. I also want to pass on my knowledge to my students and to share all the experiences that I have gained through competitions and failures and hopefully, they learn from those too.

<strong>Send:</strong> How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team? <br>
<strong>Washington:</strong> It feels great as it has always been my dream to be part of the Philippine team. And now that I made it into the team, I’m going to keep training hard and do my best to represent my country well.
